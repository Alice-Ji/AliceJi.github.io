Welcome to my page.

I am Alice, a PhD student at the Institute of Communications Research, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research explores the psychology of persuasion in digital media, examining how people engage with and interpret persuasive messages across various contexts—from advertising and influencer marketing to health communication and misinformation.

My work is methodologically diverse, incorporating eye-tracking, experimental design, computational analysis, qualitative research, and surveys to uncover how digital media shapes perception, trust, and decision-making. 

While I study a wide range of topics—including parasocial relationships, AI-generated content, misinformation correction, and the influence of LLM conversational agents like GPT models—my research is united by a central theme: 

**Understanding How Digital Environments Mediate Persuasion, Authenticity, and Consumer Behavior.**
