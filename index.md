# Alice Ji

Welcome to my page.

I am a PhD student at the Institute of Communications Research, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research explores the psychology of persuasion in digital media, examining how people engage with and interpret persuasive messages across various contextsâ€”from advertising and influencer marketing to health communication and misinformation.

My work is methodologically diverse, incorporating eye-tracking, experimental design, computational analysis, qualitative research, and surveys to uncover how digital media shapes perception, trust, and decision-making. 

While I study a wide range of topicsâ€”including parasocial relationships, AI-generated content, misinformation correction, and the influence of LLM conversational agents like GPT modelsâ€”my research is united by a central theme: 

Understanding How Digital Environments Mediate Persuasion, Authenticity, and Consumer Behavior.
